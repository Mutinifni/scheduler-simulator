# Scheduler Simulator

The idea is inspired by [radlab/sparrow](https://github.com/radlab/sparrow), it implements a event-based simulator to compare its decentralized implementation to other schedulers. And [Hawk](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc15/technical-session/presentation/delgado) augments the simulator and uses many open traces such as [google/cluster-data](https://github.com/google/cluster-data) to simulate the scheduler process.

This repo tries to implement a general simulator to integrate more scheduling algorithms, and support some open traces.
